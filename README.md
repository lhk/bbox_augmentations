## Bounding Box Augmentations

This repository contains code for augmentations of images with bounding box annotations.
The images are rotated, shifted and zoomed. The bounding boxes are updated accordingly.

The code offers fine-grained control over the augmentation mechanism and integrates nicely with Keras.

Here is an explanation of the augmentation process:

Here is demo code on how to integrate this into a machine learning workflow:
